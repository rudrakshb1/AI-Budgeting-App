# AI Budgeting App  

The **AI Budgeting App** is an Android application built with **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose** that helps users plan budgets, track transactions, and gain **AI-assisted insights** into their spending.  

Developed as part of a university Scrum project, the app integrates **Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage)** for authentication and data management, and leverages the **Google Gemini API** for chatbot support and AI-driven transaction auto-categorisation.  

With features such as budget management (weekly, monthly, yearly), receipt photo uploads, CSV import, in-app notifications, and collaborative access through the Add User function, the app provides a practical and intelligent tool for managing personal finances.

## Setup  

1. Clone & open the project in Android Studio (latest) and allow Gradle sync.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rudrakshb1/AI-Budgeting-App.git
cd ai-budgeting-app
```

2. Configure local.properties (SDK path + API Key) ‚Äì do not commit
#### Add the following to your local.properties file:
- SDK path (generated by AS)
sdk.dir=/path/to/android/sdk

- App secrets
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSy... (your key here)

üëâ For assignment grading, use the provided key (copy & paste):
```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyDNFdJSr8tmSF7S9SQLgTUTNd8fLtaxyfM
```

üëâ Alternative key (backup for testing)
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyCXvHuqZtqy1blk8gPvZzuNwjkyHNz4JTY

Note: This project uses the gemini-2.5-flash free tier model. Free API keys have token limits.
If you hit quota, generate a new API key in Google AI Studio.

3. Run on device/emulator.
Select a device/emulator (API 24+ recommended).

4. Sample login (for testing)
- Email: admin@gmail.com
- Password: 123456

5. Verify chatbot connection
- Open the app ‚Üí go to Chatbot tab
- Type /ping
- You should see response: OK (this means the chatbot is connected successfully)

## üìÇ Sample Data provided for Testing
Located in 'samples/' folder:
- receipt1.png, receipt2.jpg, receipt3.jpg ‚Üí OCR testing
- transactions_asb.csv, transactions_anz.csv ‚Üí CSV import

### Using in Android Emulator:
#### Drag & drop via emulator Files app
1. Open Files app in emulator
2. Drag receipt1.jpg / transactions_asb.csv from host PC ‚Üí emulator window
3. Files appear in Downloads folder
 - ‚ö†Ô∏è For images: open them once inside the emulator to trigger media scanning ‚Üí they will then appear in the **Gallery**  
- CSV files will remain visible in **Downloads**  

> Tip: If you have a physical receipt in front of you, you can simply use the emulator‚Äôs Camera to take a photo and let the app OCR it to pre-fill the transaction details.


### CSV Import (ASB / ANZ)
Parser expects ASB/ANZ date & column layouts.
AI-assisted categorisation: free tier usage is limited ‚Üí test with small sample files.

‚ö†Ô∏è Large CSVs may exhaust Gemini free quota quickly (line-by-line processing).

### Receipt OCR
- Upload a receipt image (via Gallery/Camera).
- OCR automatically extracts merchant and amount.
- The user then selects a category and saves the transaction.

## Key Features

- **Accounts & Security**
  - Email sign-up / login, logout, password reset, change password
  - Profile editing (display name, initials, profile photo)
  - Account deletion

- **Budgets**
  - Create weekly / monthly / yearly budgets (with start‚Äìend dates)
  - Per-category and overall budgets; edit & delete
  - Visuals: line graph & pie charts - budget vs actual (incl. overspend)

- **Transactions**
  - Add manually; categorize transactions
  - Import bank CSVs (ANZ/ASB); auto-categorisation (AI-assisted)
  - Attach receipt photos (camera / gallery), thumbnail + full-view
  - Search & filter by category/date/name
  - Monthly list view with date-based sorting

- **Reports & Export**
  - Weekly / monthly / yearly reports (recursion-aware totals)
  - Share via system share sheet (email/text)

- **Notifications & Reminders**
  - Budget threshold alerts (e.g., 90%)
  - Toggle reminders on/off; in-app notification log (mark read/delete/clear)

- **Collaboration**
  - ‚ÄúAdd User‚Äù for shared access under one owner account (TDD-driven)

- **Experience**
  - Spending trends (weekly/monthly graphs)
  - FAQ page for common questions
  - Data persists in Firestore and auto-loads after login
  - Theme customization

## Architecture
This project follows **MVVM** with a **unidirectional data flow**.

- **UI (Jetpack Compose)**: Displays state, sends user events, shows lists/charts and previews (Coil for images).
- **ViewModel**: Holds UI state with `StateFlow`, handles business logic & validation, calls repositories.
- **Repository (Data)**: Single source of truth; abstracts data access and I/O.
- **Data Sources**
  - **Firebase Auth**: Authentication & profile.
  - **Firestore**: Budgets, transactions, users, notification log.
  - **SharedPreferences**: Reminders toggle & once-per-period latch.
  - **Local cache (files/URIs)**: Profile/receipt images (*Firebase Storage planned for cross-device*).
  - **Gemini API** (OkHttp): Chatbot + AI auto-categorisation.

**Flow:** UI (event) ‚Üí ViewModel (logic) ‚Üí Repository (data) ‚Üí ViewModel (state) ‚Üí UI (render)
